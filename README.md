# MyReads Project

This is Project 6 in Udacity's Front End Nanodegree Grow with Google scholarship.

There are three sections represented as shelves. They separate the app into three categories: Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read.

Users can move around the books to show the books' current status. Simply click on the green "+" button in the bottom righthand corner, and users can search for books.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Installation
To install the app simply clone or download this repository and navigate to the folder location in your terminal. Then follow these steps:

* run npm install to install all project dependencies
* run npm start to start the development server
* navigate to localhost:3000 to view the application
